# KNN-matting

# Introduction:

This Python code demonstrates the implementation of KNN Matting, a technique designed to accurately separate the foreground of an image from its background. Using KNN Matting, the foreground is extracted with precision and can then be seamlessly overlaid onto a new background chosen by the user, creating a composite image.

Below is an example diagram for the code flow:
